= 3. Training a model - 10 minutes

== 3.1. Data Science Project

First, we will need a data science project to organize all our work: model training, model serving, application deployment. As we said earlier, a data science project is in fact an OpenShift project, but you don't need to leave the RHODS environment to create it!

=== 3.1.1. Creating the DSP

* Head to **Data Science Projects** and select **Create data science project**:

* Type the following values in the popup window, then click on `Create`.

IMPORTANT: Enter the values as written, as it is what will allow us to identify your resources and help you in case of problem (Description can be what you want though).

* *Name*: `%USERID%`
* *Resource name*: `%USERID%`
* *Description*: `This will be a great project!`

=== 3.1.2. Working with the DSP

In a Data Science Project you have different sections:

* Workbenches are development environments. They can be based on JupyterLab, but also on other types of IDEs, like VS Code or RStudio. You can create as many workbenches as you want, and they can run concurrently.
* Cluster storage are Persistent Volumes Claims (PVCs), the persistent storage spaces you can use to store your notebooks and data. You can create them directly from here, and mount them in your workbenches as you like. Note that a default cluster storage (PVC) is always automatically created with a new workbench to save your work.
* Data connections are configurations for remote data location. At the moment, only S3-compatible Object Storage is supported. We will use this feature later on to configure the storage for our models.
* Finally, Model Servers are used to serve models! But let's save that for later.

For now, let's create a new workbench for this workshop!

* select **Create workbench**

* Give it a name, select the **Custom-Optapy** image, set a Deployment size of **Small**, and a Cluster storage space of 1GB, it will be enough:

image::create_workbench_2.png[]
image::create_workbench_3.png[]

* And of course, select **Create workbench**:

image::create_workbench_click.png[]

* The workbench is created, first in the **Starting state**:

You can use this toggle to easily start/stop this environment later on.

* When it is ready, the state will change to **Running** and you can select **Open** to go to your environment:

* After authentication with your workshop username and password, and allowing permissions, you are in your familiar JupyterLab environment:

== 3.2. Fetching the project

We are now ready to do some serious work! But we need some content to work with...

* Go to the Git menu on the left:

image::git.png[]

* Then select `Clone a Repository`:

image::git_clone.png[]

* Enter the URL `https://github.com/rh-aiservices-bu/intelligent-agriculture-demo.git`, then click on `Clone`:

image::clone_repo.png[]

* It takes a few seconds, after which you can double-click and navigate to the newly-created folder, **intelligent-agriculture-demo**:

== 3.3. Model training

* In the folder `model/training`, open the file `01_crops-training.ipynb`.

* We won't have the time in this workshop to train the model for real, but take a few minutes to browse the notebook to see how the crop disease recognition model was trained.

* Now, still in the folder `model/training`, open the file `02_convert_to_onnx.ipynb`. It is a simple example showing how to convert a Keras model to the ONNX format, an open standard for machine learning interoperability, which is one we can use with OpenVino and RHODS model serving.

After training and converting this model for real, it would have been saved to a model repository, for example an S3 compatible object store. This is what has been done in advance for you!

Let's go the next section to see how to deploy this model in your project with RHODS.
